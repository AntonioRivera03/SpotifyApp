# SpotifyApp
Spotify App utilizing a server run by Selenium web scraping and a Flutter app to display music info<br>
<h2>Server built with Selenium, FastAPI, and some ServerSentEvent package (Not sure yet) to accurately update my personal spotify app</h2><br>
Idea is pretty straight forward, I want to make a stripped down version of Spotify to sit on a screen at all times while I am at work to allow for easily changing music. <br>The other reason for this is to easily categorize music I listen to and like. Thiis is done by creating a database of songs and labeling them my own labels like Indie Soft, Rap, Slow, Indie Hard, Bassy, etc..
<br>
<h2>What Needs to Be Done</h2>
<li>Learn Flutter</li>
<li>Create Flutter App</li>
<li>Implement API</li>
<li>Add Server Sent Events (SSE)</li>
<li>Create Java Version of Backend Server</li>
<li>Finalize Flutter design</li>
<li>Add album cover support</li>
<li>Create Database</li>
<li>Add headless running state</li>
